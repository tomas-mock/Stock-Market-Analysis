# Analysis of Macroeconomic Indicators and U.S. Business Sector Performance ðŸ“Š

## Description
The U.S. stock market, as a cornerstone of the global financial system, reflects the interplay between macroeconomic conditions and sectoral performance. This project investigates how key macroeconomic indicators have shaped U.S. business sectors over the past two decades, covering significant economic phases such as the dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial crisis, and periods of recovery and growth.

The objectives of the study are:
1. **Sector Performance Analysis**: Evaluate the resilience and adaptability of business sectors during expansions, recessions, and recoveries. *(My Contribution)*  
2. **Macroeconomic Relationships**: Examine the influence of indicators like unemployment rate, CPI, Federal Funds Rate, Real GDP, and consumer sentiment on sector performance.  
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a data-driven model to predict sector performance based on macroeconomic changes.

By integrating historical data with statistical techniques, this analysis provides insights for policymakers, investors, and industry stakeholders to navigate market fluctuations effectively.
